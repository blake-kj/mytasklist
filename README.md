# My Task List

My Task List is a simple task tracking web application written in JavaScript and HTML using the Materialize CSS framework.

## What I Learned

JavaScript functions: querySelector for selecting HTML elements, addEventListener to listen for an event on the DOM and run a function when the event is met & localStorage to store and load data as JSON including parsing the data from an array to a string. I also understand the basics of manipulating the DOM with JavaScript.

Materialize CSS: This framework allowed me to quickly build a HTML page based on Google's Material Design which offers an attractive UI for the JavaScript to run behind, saving me from writing many lines of CSS to achieve a similar end result.

## What's Next?

I want to further develop my understanding of JavaScript and understand another CSS framework - Bootstrap.
